                Georgia Catherine Pierce was born in St. Albans West Virginia to Carl Pierce and Clarice May. Georgia
                first married John Pennington, having two children together: Roxanne and John Pennington. After their
                separation, Georgia married John Robbins (JD) in Columbus, Ohio and had two sons: Chris and Clyde
                Robbins.
                Georgia and JD eventually found home in Hilliard, Ohio, where they raised all four kids, and worked hard
                to
                be able to purchase the family’s current house in Hilliard, Ohio. After the passing of JD, Georgia
                married
                her neighborhood friend David Boysel. Throughout Georgia’s life she worked several jobs helping family
                and
                friends make ends meet. She had jobs as a waitress, as a sales rep for the Multi-level marketing company
                Mary Kay, and also her favorite job working for The Ohio State University. Since moving to Columbus, her
                family grew deep roots for the Buckeyes with multiple grandchildren attending the University. She was a
                woman who everyone loved for the care and kindness she showed others, and she will be missed, but
                remembered
                forever.

                    One of Georgia's favorite hobbies was painting. She was an avid fan of Bob Ross, and she learned
                    from
                    his
                    techniques to create beautiful artwork. She was so good that she even sold some of her pieces. To
                    this
                    day, her art is admired throughout the country in the homes of many.

                    Georgia loved to fish, and she proved to be very good at it. On one fishing trip in Houston, she out
                    fished the entire boat of around 60 people. She not only caught her limit but Clyde's and David's
                    limit
                    also. The Captain of the boat even got on the radio and said to the other boats that "You should see
                    this woman I have on my boat, she's out-fishing the entire boat!" That day she caught so much
                    Snapper
                    that they had to give most of it to the Captain because their cooler wasn’t large enough. Giving up
                    that
                    snapper was definitely her least favorite part of that trip.

                    Georgia loved to travel; especially to places, she had never been before. Every summer in the 1960’s
                    and early 1970’s she used the money that she had made from tips as a waitress to take her family to
                    different states in the US. To this day, these trips were some of the best memories that her kids
                    have of her and their family. Later in Georgia’s life, she visited her son John Pennington while he
                    was stationed in Hawaii for the US Navy. Georgia went with her late husband Dave Boysel who recalls
                    this as one of the best times of their life.

                    Georgia was a true believer in Jesus Christ and was a regular member of the Briggs Road Baptist
                    Church in Hilliard, Ohio. Her love of God was evident in how she loved and took care of anyone who
                    needed it. If you were hungry, she would feed you; if you needed a place to sleep, she would give
                    you a roof to sleep under.
